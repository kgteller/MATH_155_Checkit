    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        A study compared the birth weights of non-Hispanic white babies born in the US in 1994 to birth weights of Mexican-American babies in the US in 1994. Both sets of birth weights were found to be normally distributed. The mean birth weight of non-Hispanic white babies was 3,393 grams with a standard deviation of 562 grams. The mean birth weight of Mexican-American babies was 3,343 grams with a standard deviation of 598 grams. Please use this information to answer the questions below.
