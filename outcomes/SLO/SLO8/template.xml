    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        A study compared the birth weights of non-Hispanic white babies born in the US in 1994 to birth weights of Mexican-American babies in the US in 1994. Both sets of birth weights were found to be normally distributed. The mean birth weights from as sample of {{n1}} non-Hispanic white babies was {{mean1}} grams with a standard deviation of {{STD1}} grams. The mean birth weight from a sample of {{n2}} Mexican-American babies was {{mean2}} grams with a standard deviation of {{STD2}} grams. Please use this information to answer the questions below.
       </p>
        <p> We want to construct a {{CL}} \% Confidence interval about the mean weight for {{ind_1}} babies. {{zort}} </p>
