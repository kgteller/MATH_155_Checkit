    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        In many areas of medicine, there are different measurements used to define “healthy” based on gender, age, and race. One such measurement is bone density. Bone density is important, because as we age, bone density can decrease. If it decreases too much, we become at much higher risk of breaking bones.
       </p>
    <p>
        For example, people aged 25, a sample of {{n1}} White Women has a mean bone density of {{mean1}} with a standard deviation of {{STD1}} and a sample of {{n2}} Black Women has a mean bone density of {{mean2}} with a standard deviation of {{STD2}}.
