        <p>Poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality: The world faces many great and terrifying problems. It is these large problems that our work at Our World in Data focuses on. Our World in Data is a non-profit that has as its mission to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable.
